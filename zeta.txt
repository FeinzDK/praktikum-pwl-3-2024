"A corpse... should be left well alone.
Oh, I know very well. How the secrets beckon so sweetly.
Only an honest death will cure you now.
Liberate you, from your wild curiosity."

"In the silence of the pages, echoes of past lives resonate. 
each word a heartbeat, each line a fleeting moment of existence."
